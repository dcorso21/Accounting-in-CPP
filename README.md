# Accounting-in-CPP

## Introduction:

This was a simple project idea that I found at  https://www.codewithc.com/c-projects-with-source-code/

I decided to take a crack at this myself. I had fiddled around with C++ before, but this was my first project using classes and so on 
----  even if it is a pretty small project.

## Goals:

- Create a simple console interface
- Manage a csv file through C++ vectors and 
- Enable the user to view the database, add entries and delete them with a clean interface
- And More to come...

## Results! 

I was able to accomplish these simple tasks fairly quickly and learned a lot about C++ while doing so. I learned quite a bit about class member functions,
stringstream, std::cout and std::cin and more. Pretty simple stuff, but I'm pretty proud with the results below for such a quick project.
